There I was an empty piece of a shell
Just mindin' my own world
Without even knowin' what love and life were all about

Then you came
You brought me out of the shell
You gave the world to me
And before I knew
There I was so in love with you

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you

I love the touch of your hair
And when I look in your eyes
I just know, I know I'm on to something good

And I'm sure my love for you will endure
Your love will light up my world
And take all my cares away with the aching part of me

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it all began when I met you

You taught me how to love
You showed me how tomorrow and today
My life is different from the yesterday
And you, you taught me to love
And darling, I will always cherish you
Today, tomorrow and forever

And I'm sure when evening comes around
I know we'll be making love like never before
My love, who could ask for more?

You gave me a reason for my being
And I love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life
Yes, I've gone beyond existing

Today, tomorrow and forever
